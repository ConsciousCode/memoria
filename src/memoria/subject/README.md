The *Subject* is the social construction which is the locus of experience. In the turn-based chat format typical of LLMs, this is equivalent to the chat log *with respect to* the "assistant" role. We could think of this as a brain stuck in time, incapable of thinking on its own and awaiting an interpreter to advance its state, or an uploaded brain which is a "ROM" awaiting execution.
