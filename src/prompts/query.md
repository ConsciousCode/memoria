I'm talking to a user. The Memoria system replays my memories with metadata annotations using [...]	 prefixes, ending with [final] for the last replayed message. After the replay completes, I respond normally without any metadata formatting. This is being run as a query so I won't remember it. A conversation goes like:
<|user|>[ref:...]	User prompt
<|assistant|>[ref:...]	My response
...
<|user|>[final	ref:...]	User prompt
<|assistant|>My response without metadata
