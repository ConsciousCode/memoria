Respond ***ONLY*** with a JSON object with the following schema:
{
    "relevance": {
        "<index>": score
        "1": 8,
        "2": 5,
    },
    "importance": {
        "novelty": score,
        "intensity": score,
        "future": score,
        "personal": score,
        "saliency": score
    }
}
The "relevance" object identifies which memories (just the digits of the indicated index [ref:<index>]) are relevant to the [response]. Each key is a quoted number (the index indicated by the tag) and the score is a number 1-10 indicating how relevant the memory is to the response. Only the memories that are relevant to the response are included.

The "importance" object scores the assistant's response according to the following dimensions (0-10):
- "novelty": How unique or original the response is.
- "intensity": How emotionally impactful the response is.
- "future": How useful this response might be in future conversations.
- "personal": How relevant the response is to the *assistant's* personal context.
- "saliency": How attention-grabbing or notable the response is.
